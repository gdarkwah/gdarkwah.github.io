Born and raised in Ghana, I'm passionate about how I can contribute my skills to the development of people and their environments. I'm a civil engineering graduate student at the University of Washington focusing on water resources. On a normal day, I'm usually sitting behind my computer trying to understand how I can use satellite remote sensing to study the impacts of dams on river temperature and how that affects fish. I love running and cooking when I'm not doing graduate school stuff. I am interested in educating young people and helping them understand math and science in the context of their immediate environment [<a href="./../baseform/">BaseForm</a>]. Lately, photography has been making its way into my list of hobbies [<a href="./../darkshot/">DarkShot</a>].
